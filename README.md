###### Java 11 SDK required

* Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/tscript3r/photogram.git
cd photogram
./mvnw package
java -jar backend/target/*.jar
```

mvnw.cmd package
java -jar backend/target/*.jar

By executing maven package goal frontend will be production ready builded and copied into resources of backend, so
that http server of backend runs also the frontend part. Default port is 8080, so after running the jar just visit:
http://localhost:8080
